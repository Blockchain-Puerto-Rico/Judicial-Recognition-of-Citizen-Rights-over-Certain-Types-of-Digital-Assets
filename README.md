# Judicial-Recognition-of-Citizen-Rights-over-Certain-Types-of-Digital-Assets
A bill to be submitted at the Puerto Rico legislature with the objective of safeguarding the rights of Puerto Rico residents over their personal property on the internet and promoting the development of digital commerce on the island, specifically within the context of tokens that exist on a blockchain network or similar distributed ledger technology.

## Introduction
This Repository Corresponds to a Bill that will be submitted to the Legislature of Puerto Rico to ammend the Law of Commercial Transactions of Puerto Rico (Ley de Transacciones Comerciales de Puerto Rico).

Puerto Rico is a Civil Law Jurisdiction, the Law of Commercial Transactions of Puerto Rico is a law that was written in Spanish, **this Bill will ultimately be submitted in Spanish to the Legislature.** 

The purpose of this repository is to significantly influence the contents of the bill in an effort to make it as robust as possible. The bill must not only benefit those that already hold significant amounts of cryptoassets, but those that do not hold as many and those that do not yet own any at all but will eventually begin to hold. 

### Contents of the Repository

The Repository will be divided into two main sections: English Version & Spanish Version. Both versions pertain to the same content of the final bill, except that each is written in the corresponding language. A good faith effort will be made to ensure that both versions accurately reflect the same content but some words/terms don't translate into Spanish and other words/terms don't translate into English.


## Bill Requirements

The Secretary of the Legislature requires certain formatting criteria that will not be fully addressed in the opensource document. However, any bill submmited to the Legislature generally consists of a: 

 - [ ] Header
 - [ ] Bill Enumeration
 - [ ] Bill Title 
 - [ ] Exposition of Motives **Purpose**
 - [ ] Decretative Text
 - [ ] Validity Clause

## What We Will Mainly Doing

On this Github Repository we will mainly be working on the Exposition of Motives and the Decretative Text. The first is important for interpreting the text of the law after it has been made into law and the latter is the actual text of the law.
